The code in this branch is a prototype of Tusk. It supplements the paper [Narwhal and Tusk: A DAG-based Mempool and Efficient BFT Consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf) enabling reproducible resuts. All data points used to produce the graphs of the paper are available in the folder [results/data](/results/data). There are no plans to maintain this branch. The [master branch](https://github.com/facebookresearch/narwhal) contains the most recent and polished version of this codebase. 


**Note:** Please run tests on a single thread:
